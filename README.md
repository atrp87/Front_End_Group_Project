## Soical Mobile Application

Worked in a team of three where we used Agile methodologies (SCRUM), solo and mob programming.

We had one week to create a Mobile application that allows users to create a profile of themselves with pictures and intrests and they can swipe throught suitable hosts. Users can select hosts to view their profile and if it meets the users social criteria they can match themselfs for the hosts venue or filter the hosts list to the users specific intrests.

During this project we got to consolidate and expand on everything I had learnt in the previous 9 weeks @ CodeClan, as well as work on a new Tech stack that was not in the curriculum and the team agreed on React Native.

* Java
* Spring Boot DevTools & Spring Web
* Spring Data JPA & H2 Database
* React Native
* Git & GitHub
* Agile methodologies

### Project Overview:

* The app should allow the user to create, edit and delete the user profile.
* The app should allow the user to view a list of Hosts available.
* The app should allow the user to filter host by category, e.g. Music Genre, Venue Type and Expense.
* The app should allow the user to select light and dark theme.
